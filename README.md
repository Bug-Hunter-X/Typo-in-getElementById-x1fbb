# Uncommon HTML Error: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in HTML/JavaScript: a typo in the `getElementById` method.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  This kind of error can be difficult to debug because it often doesn't produce a clear error message in the console, but simply fails silently.
